![Alt text](/assets/Gut-brain-mechansoensation.png)

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Introduction
This repo contains codes and script used  to analyze data from  minimally invasive probe targeting perceptions of the gastrointestinal system via ingestion of a vibrating capsule. Scripts were used to analyze combined the mechanosensory stimulation of stomach signals with perceptual measurement of stomach sensations and continuous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrogastrogram (EGG), and other peripheral physiological signals.
## Contents
* ERP and Perceptual Measures
  * Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Supplement Figures.
* Peripheral Physiological Signals
  * Figure 4, Figure 9 and Supplement Figures.
### Dependencies

* R

### Executing program
First, raw data used to generate the manuscript should be downloaded after obtaining proper acess through [Dr. Sahib S. Khalsa] (skhalsa@laureateinstitute.org). <br />
Each script was named based on the associated figure and stats used in the manuscript. 

```
Run Figure4.Rmd in RStudio
