## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Introduction
This repo contains codes and script used  to analyze data from  minimally invasive probe targeting perceptions of the gastrointestinal system via ingestion of a vibrating capsule. Scripts were used to analyze combined the mechanosensory stimulation of stomach signals with perceptual measurement of stomach sensations and continuous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrogastrogram (EGG), and other peripheral physiological signals.
