# Neural Indicators of Gut-Brain Mechanosensation

![Alt text](/assets/Gut-brain-mechansoensation.png)

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Introduction
This repo contains codes and scripts used to analyze data from minimally invasive probe targeting perceptions of the gastrointestinal system via capsule vibration. Please refer to  this manuscript [Reference](#Reference) for more information.The scripts were desinged to analyze the mechanosensory stimulation of stomach signals with perceptual measurement of stomach sensations and continuous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrogastrogram (EGG), and other peripheral physiological signals.
## Data Access 
All raw data are available under the data directory in this repo. Most of the data are in csv long format except for Figures 2b, 3, S2, 8b, S3 and S4, which are shared in edf/mat format. <br />
If you have any question, please contact Dr. Sahib S. Khalsa at Laureate Institute for Brain Research: <br />

## Contents
Codes are separated based on the type of analysis:
* [ERP and Perceptual Measures](ERP%20and%20Perceptual%20Measures)
  * Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Supplement Figures.
* [Peripheral Physiological Signals](Peripheral%20Physiological%20Signals)
  * Figure 4, Figure 9 and Supplement Figures.
### Dependencies

* R

### Executing program
After downloading the data, each script can be used to generate the correspoding analysis:
