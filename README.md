![Alt text](/assets/Gut-brain-mechansoensation.png)

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Introduction
This repo contains codes and scripts used to analyze data from minimally invasive probe targeting perceptions of the gastrointestinal system via capsule vibration. Please refer to  this manuscript [Reference](##Reference) for more information.The scripts were desinged to analyze the mechanosensory stimulation of stomach signals with perceptual measurement of stomach sensations and continuous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrogastrogram (EGG), and other peripheral physiological signals.
## Data Access 
Due to data privacy and intellectual property, not all data are available through this repo. However, data can be requested through Dr. Sahib S. Khalsa at Laureate Institute for Brain Research: <br />

## Contents
Codes are seperated based on the type of analysis:
* [ERP and Perceptual Measures](ERP%20and%20Perceptual%20Measures)
  * Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Supplement Figures.
* [Peripheral Physiological Signals](Peripheral%20Physiological%20Signals)
  * Figure 4, Figure 9 and Supplement Figures.
### Dependencies

* R

### Executing program
After downloading the data, each script can be used to generate the correspoding analysis:
